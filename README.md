Typing Game
This is a real-time multiplayer typing game built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.io. Players can join as either a host or a joiner, and the game will start when both roles are assigned. The goal is to type the given text as fast and accurately as possible.

Features
Real-time multiplayer gameplay with Socket.io.

The host player starts the game, and the joiner waits for the host to start.

Speed and accuracy are tracked during the typing process.

Displays the opponentâ€™s progress as they type.

The first player to complete the text wins.

Game resets when one player leaves or refreshes the page.

Challenges Faced
Socket.io Room Management:

One of the main challenges was to manage the real-time connection between the host and the joiner using Socket.io. Initially, the game was starting before the second player (joiner) connected, which led to issues with synchronization and roles.

Solution: I made sure the game only starts when both the host and the joiner are connected. I added logic to handle role assignments and ensure the game starts when the second player joins.

Role Assignment and Game Flow:

Ensuring that the host and joiner roles were assigned correctly and that the game started at the appropriate time was tricky. I had to handle scenarios where players tried to join after the game had already started or when the host was not assigned.

Solution: I added checks to ensure that the host role was assigned to the first player, and the joiner could only join once the host was ready. Players were shown a waiting screen until the game started.

Game State Resetting:

When a player left or refreshed the page, it was important to reset the game state to allow for a fresh start.

Solution: I added event listeners to detect when a player disconnects and reset the game, ensuring that the remaining player is notified and the game restarts if necessary.

Typing Speed Calculation:

Calculating the typing speed based on reaction times and displaying it with a needle was challenging, especially when trying to ensure smooth animation and accurate calculations.

Solution: I implemented a speed calculation function that measures the time between key presses and updates the speed dynamically on the screen.

Preventing Pasting:

I wanted to ensure that players couldn't paste text into the input area, as it would invalidate the typing challenge.

Solution: I added an event listener to prevent pasting in the input area, forcing players to type the text.
